About: A boss of mine once mentioned how he wished he could invoice Microsoft
for all the hours he has paid developers to deal with Internet Explorer. Combine
the idea with the fact that all developers have a deep need to bitch about IE,
and viola...you have this site.

Now the numbers... the numbers are completely bogus. I simply assigned ratios
to various version of IE based on how much a developer might pad his hours to
cover the support.

If anyone has any clever ideas on how we could make the math a bit more
accurate, I am all ears.
